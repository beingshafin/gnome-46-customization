Hello Fellow Reader,
This script contains heavy customization and package installation over gnome system.
Its completely normal if your screen turns out blank making your mind go to nothingness.
Do not worry its just linux's way of recognising new dconf file sometimes Haha
Just reboot your system and run the script again. 
The script will continue from onwards where it left off.
